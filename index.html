                    <div class="faq-question">Am I eligible if I was hit by a commercial vehicle?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Yes, if you were injured in an accident where a commercial or work vehicle hit you, you may be eligible for significant compensation. This includes accidents involving delivery trucks, service vans, company cars, construction vehicles, and even rideshare vehicles being used for work purposes.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How much compensation could I qualify for?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Compensation varies based on factors like injury severity, medical expenses, lost wages, and liability. Commercial vehicle accidents often qualify for higher settlements due to commercial insurance policies and potential employer liability. Many of our clients have received settlements ranging from $50,000 to over $500,000.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Do I need to pay anything upfront?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">No. Our partner attorneys work on a contingency fee basis, meaning you pay nothing unless they win your case. There are no upfront costs, consultation fees, or hidden charges. You only pay a percentage of your settlement after you receive compensation.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What if the accident was partially my fault?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Depending on your state's laws, you may still be eligible for compensation even if you were partially at fault. This is known as comparative negligence. For example, if you were 20% at fault, you might still recover 80% of your damages. Our attorneys can evaluate your specific situation.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How long does a commercial vehicle accident claim take?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Most commercial vehicle accident claims are resolved within 6-18 months, depending on the complexity of the case and the parties involved. Simple cases may settle faster, while complex cases involving multiple parties or severe injuries might take longer.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Why are commercial vehicle accidents different from regular accidents?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Commercial vehicle accidents typically involve higher insurance policy limits, potential employer liability, and may be subject to additional regulations. This often means more potential compensation for victims. Additionally, companies may have more resources to investigate accidents quickly, making it important for you to seek legal help promptly.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What if I was a pedestrian or cyclist hit by a work vehicle?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Pedestrians and cyclists hit by work vehicles often have strong claims for compensation. These cases may involve significant injuries and clear liability against the commercial driver and their employer. Our network of attorneys has extensive experience representing pedestrians and cyclists in these situations.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What types of damages can I recover?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">You may be eligible to recover medical expenses (past and future), lost wages, loss of earning capacity, pain and suffering, emotional distress, property damage, and in some cases, punitive damages. Our attorneys work to maximize all available compensation sources.</div>
